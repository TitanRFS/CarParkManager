# CarParkManager

This is a JavaFX application that serves as a car park manager. It provides functionality to register cars, park and unpark cars, and generate a report on the car park status. The application utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with users.

## WORK IN PROGRESS.
Basic functionality achieved.Looking into adding some styling for the app.

## Features

- **Registering Cars:** Users can add new cars to the car park by providing the license plate number and owner name.
- **Parking and Unparking Cars:** Users can select a registered car from the combo box and park it in the car park. Similarly, parked cars can be selected and unparked, freeing up parking spaces.
- **Car Tables:** The application displays two tables: "Registered Cars" and "Parked Cars." The "Registered Cars" table shows the license plate number and owner name of the cars that are registered in the system. The "Parked Cars" table displays the license plate number and owner name of the cars currently parked in the car park. The tables are updated dynamically as cars are registered, parked, or unparked.
- **Occupancy and Capacity Labels:** The application shows the current occupancy and capacity of the car park. The "Occupancy Label" displays the number of cars currently parked, and the "Capacity Label" shows the maximum capacity of the car park.
- **Saving and Loading Car Park Data:** Users can save the car park data to a text file and load data from a previously saved file.
- **Generate Report:** Users can generate a report that displays the number of registered cars, the number of parked cars, and the current status of the car park (whether it is full or has available spaces).
